<h1>hellstar</h1>
<p>We are a "one man" company, our workshop is located in Barcelona, Spain. All products on our site are hand made, made to order. Shirts are hand printed, facemasks are handsewn one by one. One of the reasons behind the brand's success is its popularity with rappers. Webpage What's On The Star documents the brands worn by hip-hop artists among other famous wearers, regularly featuring Hellstar on its page. When will my order ship? Orders are usually shipped between 3-5 business days, this is because all products are made to order. All orders are shipped with a tracking number.
With a unique concept centred around the prospect of Earth being a place of hell where its inhabitants are stars, Hellstar has taken the streetwear world by storm. Holland is the child of a pastor, weaving a Christian message into his logoed clobber.
How do Hellstar Studios T-Shirts fit? We suggest ordering true to size! Hellstar shirts are made with custom milled cotton, finished with a vintage wash and potassium spray to give it a high quality feeling.
The "Hellstar" font used in the Hellstar Records logo appears to be a custom or modified version of the "Retro Starstruck" font, which is a display font designed by Blambot.
